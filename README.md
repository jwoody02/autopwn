# autopwn
basic python file to automate nmap and other host discovery scans

I made this sophomore year in high school when I began experimenting with exploits so this script should have a cgi exploit that will run if the vulnerability is found on victim's computer

I shouldn't have to say this but only run on a computer you own lol it be illegal to attack any other computer with the script.
